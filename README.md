# Finding Alpha with AI
In these series of jupyter notebooks, we will go over how to create simple yet powerful models for strategies in the stock market. 

In the [first notebook], we evaluate and visualize different models to determine the correlation between their outputs, in order to create diverse strategies that will perform well when combined into one model.

In the [second notebook], we evaluate and visualize the average returns of different combinations of parameters (specifically the n period interval and n period look back), in order to determine the best performing parameters.
